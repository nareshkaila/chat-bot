# chat-bot

#Overview
This project uses BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to build a chatbot capable of understanding and generating human-like responses. The chatbot utilizes the Hugging Face Transformers library for BERT-based models and Streamlit for an interactive web interface. It allows users to chat with the bot in real-time.

#Features
Real-time chatbot interaction through a simple web interface.
BERT-based model for generating contextually relevant responses.
Stateful conversation that maintains context across multiple turns.
Simple and user-friendly UI built with Streamlit.

#Technologies Used
Python – Programming language.
Streamlit – Framework for building interactive web applications.
Hugging Face Transformers – Pretrained BERT model for chatbot responses.
PyTorch – Backend for BERT model inference.
NumPy – For numerical operations.
