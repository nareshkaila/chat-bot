# chat-bot

#Overview
This project uses BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to build a chatbot capable of understanding and generating human-like responses. The chatbot utilizes the Hugging Face Transformers library for BERT-based models and Streamlit for an interactive web interface. It allows users to chat with the bot in real-time.

#Features
Real-time chatbot interaction through a simple web interface.
BERT-based model for generating contextually relevant responses.
Stateful conversation that maintains context across multiple turns.
Simple and user-friendly UI built with Streamlit.

#Technologies Used
Python – Programming language.
Streamlit – Framework for building interactive web applications.
Hugging Face Transformers – Pretrained BERT model for chatbot responses.
PyTorch – Backend for BERT model inference.
NumPy – For numerical operations.

#Key Features in app.py:
BERT-based Model: The chatbot uses a pre-trained BERT model (in this case, bert-base-uncased) from Hugging Face for understanding and generating responses.
Real-Time Interaction: Users can input text in a simple text box, and the bot will generate a response.
Response Generation: The generate_response function takes the input, feeds it through the BERT model, and decodes the response.

#his structure provides an easy-to-use BERT-based chatbot with a Streamlit UI. The user types in a message, and the chatbot responds using a BERT model. You can extend this project further by adding more sophisticated conversation management (e.g., adding memory to the conversation or integrating with more advanced NLP models for better coherence).
